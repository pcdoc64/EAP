    <p>Welcome.<br><br>This online version of the EAP has been designed to assist leaders to easily create an Event Package, submit for approval to their Group Leader or transfer ownership to another leader.</p>
    <p>You are able to create new camp sites or discover sites used by other leaders.</p>
    <p>Create new Programs which include a range of activity types (abseiling, canoeing, camping, hiking etc) or use a Program already created.</p>
    <p>If that Program has risks already associated with it, they will automatically be added to your F31 Risk Assessment form.
    <p>The package works best if you create your Event in the following order.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="index.php?pg=site">1. Sites</a></li><p style="color:blue">Know of a great camping site, or looking for one? Use a site someone else has created, or make a new one to share. You can get full instructions to get to the site from any location.</p>
      <li><a href="index.php?pg=actv">2. Programs</a></li><p style="color:blue">Create a Program, from short day visits, to week long camps. Include the activities you will be doing, and the Risk Assessments for those activities will be automatically added to your program.</p>
      <li><a href="index.php?pg=aap">3. Activity Pack</a></li><p style="color:blue">Create your full Event Pack here.<br> Just add your Site and Program an you will get your C5, permission forms, F31 Risk Assessments, Program and Menu's (Menu's to be added soon). Once created, you can submit it for your Group Leader to review and approve.</p>
<!--      <li><a href="index.php?pg=risk">Risk Items</a></li><p style="color:blue">If a Risk Item you need is not already in the list, create a new one to use.</p> -->
<!--      <li><a href="index.php?pg=cmenu">Camp Menus</a></li><p style="color:blue">Create a fantastic camp menu from the items included, or use one already created. Its easy to do and will provide a shopping list for you.</p> -->
